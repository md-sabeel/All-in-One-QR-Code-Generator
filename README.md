All-in-One QR Code Generator using pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript with:

✅ Multiple QR types (most popular ones covered)
✅ Dynamic form switcher
✅ QR preview
✅ Download QR as PNG
✅ Navbar + Footer with your GitHub credit
✅ Mobile + Desktop friendly
✅ Easy to extend (you can add more types later)

⚠️ Note (important & honest):
All QR codes are technically text-based. Platforms like YouTube, Wi-Fi, UPI, WhatsApp, etc. are just formatted strings.
This generator correctly handles real-world formats for popular types (Wi-Fi, WhatsApp, Email, Phone, SMS, Maps, UPI, Social links, Files, etc.).
